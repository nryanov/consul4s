sealed trait Check

/**
 *
 * @param name - Specifies the name of the check.
 * @param args - Specifies command arguments to run to update the status of the check.
 * @param interval - Specifies the frequency at which to run this check. This is required for HTTP and TCP checks.
 * @param timeout - Specifies a timeout for outgoing connections in the case of a Script, HTTP, TCP, or gRPC check. Can be specified in the form of "10s" or "5m" (i.e., 10 seconds or 5 minutes, respectively).
 * @param id - Specifies a unique ID for this check on the node. This defaults to the "Name" parameter, but it may be necessary to provide an ID for uniqueness.
 * @param serviceId - Specifies the ID of a service to associate the registered check with an existing service provided by the agent.
 * @param status - Specifies the initial status of the health check.
 * @param notes - Specifies arbitrary information for humans. This is not used by Consul internally.
 * @param deregisterCriticalServiceAfter - Specifies that checks associated with a service should deregister after this time. This is specified as a time duration with suffix like "10m". If a check is in the critical state for more than this configured value, then its associated service (and all of its associated checks) will automatically be deregistered. The minimum timeout is 1 minute, and the process that reaps critical services runs every 30 seconds, so it may take slightly longer than the configured timeout to trigger the deregistration. This should generally be configured with a timeout that's much, much longer than any expected recoverable outage for the given service.

 *

Certificate verification can be controlled using the TLSSkipVerify.
